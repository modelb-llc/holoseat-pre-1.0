Holoseat Desktop App Technology Demos

This directory contains a series of technology demos/tests for the Holoseat
desktop application.  These demos run in separate processes, but share a common
virtualenv environment.  After installing and activating the virtualenv, you can
install the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

See individual readme files for instructions on running the various demos.
